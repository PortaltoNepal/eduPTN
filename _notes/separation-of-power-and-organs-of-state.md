## Introduction

The term &#39;Separation of power&#39; is ascribed to **French Enlightenment political philosopher Baron de Montesquieu**. Montesquieu described division of political power among a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary. He based this model on the Constitution of the Roman Republic and the British constitutional system. Montesquieu took the view that the Roman Republic had powers separated so that no one could usurp complete power. In the British constitutional system, Montesquieu perceived a separation of powers among the monarch, Parliament, and the courts of law.

James Madison provided that the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few or many and whether hereditary, self-appointed or elective may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.

## Checks and balances

To prevent one branch from becoming supreme, protect the &quot;opulent minority&quot; from the majority, and to induce the branches to cooperate, government systems that employ a separation of powers need a way to balance each of the branches. Typically this was accomplished through a system of &quot; **checks and balances**&quot;, the origin of which, like separation of powers itself, is specifically credited to Montesquieu. Checks and balances allow for a system based regulation that allows one branch to limit another, such as the power of Congress to alter the composition and jurisdiction of the federal courts.

### Provision of Check and Balance in the Constitution of Nepal

1. Executive checks Judiciary
	- Art.118: Expenditures chargeable as Federal Consolidated Fund: Remuneration of Chief Justice of Nepal, Judges of Supreme Court and members of Judicial Council
	- Art. 138: Annual Report of Judiciary to President: President submits such report to federal parliament via PM.
2. Executive checks Parliament:
	- Art.118: Expenditure chargeable on Federal Consolidated Fund: Remuneration of speaker, Deputy speaker of House of Representative and chairman and vice chairman of National Assembly.
3. Parliament Checks Executive:
	- Art. 97: Formation of Parliamentary Committee
	- Art. 100: Provision relating to vote of confidence and motion of no confidence

	- Art. 103: No question to be raised in the court regarding internal business of parliament
1. Judiciary Checks Executive:

1. Judiciary Checks Parliament:

**Balance** is a consequence of checking. It needs no other effort to balance the organs than the act of checking. Therefore check is action and balance is the consequence of act of checking.

## Merits of Separation of power
- Creates greater governmental **efficiency**
- To make law in **common interest**.
- To assure that the law is **impartially administered** and that all administrators are under the law.
- To make **accountable** the officials for abuse of power.
- To establish a **balance** of Governmental power.
- To **specialize** government functions.
- To avoid a **concentration** of too much power.

## Demerits of separation of Power
- If executive, legislative and judicial power is separated absolutely without checks and balances, it may raise institutional tyranny.
- Legislative and executive have reciprocal relationship in parliamentary system.
- Checks and balance subsystem must be developed and followed to maintain the separation of power theory.
- Executive would be at deadlock rather than dynamic situation if separation of power is done absolutely.
- Separation of Power is source of tension between the three organ of Government.

## Separation of Power and Administrative Law

Separation of power is relative and not absolute. Separation of Power not only provides each branch with somewhat different authority over public administration but may also frustrate coordination among them. All three organs have interests in public administration.

The separation of power is not in essence concerned with allocation of functions only. Its primary function is prevention of arbitrary government or tyranny which may arise due to concentration of power. Thus we can see that public administrators make rules (legislative function), implement these rules (an executive function), and adjudicate questions concerning their applications and executions (a judicial function).

## Conclusion

The separation of powers means reciprocal checks and balances among various branches-not among the branches, but bridges that balance and control.
