A.V. Dicey has pointed out that whenever there is discretion, there is room for arbitrariness and that in a republic no less than under a monarchy discretionary authority on the part of the government must mean insecurity for legal freedom on the part of its subject. Thus, unfettered and vast discretionary powers on the administrative authorities lead to mal-administration, corruption, suppression and atrocities. Therefore, there should be judicial control or review over the decisions given in exercise of discretionary powers by the administrative authorities.

Administrative discretion is not a term provided by statutes, thus to understand it we separate the term, where ‘Administration’ in public law means, the practical management and direction of executive department and its agencies. Whereas ‘Discretion’ in this sense means choosing from amongst the various available alternatives but with reference to the rule of reason and justice and not according to personal whims.

Discretionary powers conferred on the administration are of different type. They may range from simple ministerial function like maintenance of birth and death register to powers which seriously affect the rights of an individual, e.g. acquisition of property, regulation of trade, industry or business, investigation, seizer, confiscation and destruction of property, detention of a person on subjective satisfaction of an executive authority and the like.

In short administrative discretion is a powers or authorities provided to the executive by which freedom is given to maintain government system, society, rights and solely to satisfy people aims to live.

Coke proclaims “Discretion” as “it is a science or understanding to discern between falsity and truth, between right and wrong, between shadows and substance, between equity and colorable glosses and pretences, and not to do according to their will and private affection”  
Thus it can be said that decision taken by the administrative authorities are not only based on the evidence but in accordance to the policy and also in accordance to the discretionary power conferred on the authority.

The main Concern of Administration Discretion is the discretionary powers given to the authorities must be exercised properly in accordance with and within the limits of law from which it derives the power. As the function of the state becomes increasingly complex, judicial control of administrative actions has advanced. The courts have to perform the difficult task of allowing maximum freedom to administrative authorities in the choice of their responses without letting them act arbitrarily.

## Necessity of Administrative Discretion

 - Any form of Government cannot function without the exercise of some discretion by the officials. However, it must be understood that absolute discretion is a ruthless master.
 - It is humanely impossible to lay down a rule for every conceivable eventuality in the complex art of modern government.
 - It is necessary for individualization of individual power.
 - Discretionary power by itself is not pure evil.

## Judicial Review of Administrative Discretion

It is rightly said, ‘every power tends to corrupt and absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely. 'When discretionary powers are submitted to any administrative authority than it must be handled lawfully. When power is conferred to a officer for some purpose and which is been exercise by that officer on its own mala-fide discretion for improper purpose or act in bad faith is considered as abuse of the power.

An administrative authority has been declared his discretionary power and subject matter that how to apply, where to apply, at what level to apply. But if this authority exceeds what has been provided in the statutes or provisions enacted for their discretion in sense of the delegating power. It is the duty of the court to find out whether this authority is working under a statute and the limit of its power that to be exercised.

The main Purpose of Judicial Review is:
- To maintain Constitutional supremacy and propriety.
- To protect citizen’s fundamental rights.
- To make sure that discretion conferred by statutes has been lawfully exercised.
- To ensure that the decision maker has acted fairly.
- To confirm that the exercise of power by a public body does not violate human rights.

## Grounds for Judicial Review:

 1. Jurisdiction:
    - Lack of jurisdiction: if authority exercises jurisdiction which did not belong to it.
    - Excess of jurisdiction: If authority exceeded the jurisdiction initially provided to it.
    - Abuse of jurisdiction: If jurisdiction is used with malafide intention.
    - Failure to exercise jurisdiction: If authority denies exercising jurisdiction.
2. Irrationality:
    - Taking into consideration irrelevant material
    - Ignoring relevant material
    - Using power for improper purpose
    - Exercising power in malafide manner.
 3. Procedural Impropriety:
The procedure for taking administrative decision and action must be fair, reasonable and just. If the law is silent then administration must follow principles of natural justice which provide fair minimum procedures which must be followed. The rule against bias and rule against fair hearing is to be followed.
4. Proportionality:
Administrative action should not be more drastic than it needs to be for obtaining desired result.
5. Unreasonableness:
If the conclusion reached by the authority is not based on facts or decision is partial.

## Modes of Judicial Review of Administrative Action/ Discretion:

1. Public Law Remedy: Writ of Certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, habeas corpus and quo warranto can be filed.
2. Private Law Remedy
	- Injunction: can be a tool against administrative discretion.
	- Declaratory Relief: Judgements and orders are usually determinants of rights in the actual circumstances of which the court has cognizance and given some relief capable of being enforced. Declaratory judgments may be given which the court is authorized for.
3. Public Interest Litigation (PIL): PIL can be filed for issues of public concern. Liberal locus standi has been provided by law for filing PIL.

## Some cases:
### Achyut Krishna Kharel vs. Council of Ministers and Others (NKP 2055)
In this case the question of administrative discretion was put to the government for the appointment of New Inspector General of Police before the expiry of the tenure of the existing Inspector General of police. The court states its verdict stating that the act done by the government is not only baseless but also rather done with the malafide intention and is thus against the principle of rule of law. So, the decision of the government was the misuse of the discretionary power and is not to be applied further. The court in its decision also stated that it is unfortunate to have this issue tarnished with the political cause and hence has condemned the act of the government.

In this case, the court has defined the meaning of administrative discretion which according to it should not be exercised by the whim of the office holder rather it should be consistent to the principles of law and justice. It laid emphasis that the discretion should not flow beyond the line.

### Rabi Raj Bhandari vs. PM Man Mohan Adhikari (NKP Golden Jubilee Special Edition (2052)

The court in this case held that Prime Minister cannot dissolve the parliament as to exercise his prerogative right over ruling the previous case which had recognized the right of house dissolution as a prerogative right of the Prime Minister. He cannot use his prerogative right as there was vote of no confidence against him in the parliament. The prime minister has to face the no confidence movement in the Parliament as he is answerable to the members of the parliament since he is also the representative of the members of parliament to the government.
