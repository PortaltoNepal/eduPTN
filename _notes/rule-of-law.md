## Introduction

Rule of Law provides the basis for the idea of &#39;Limited Government&#39; and Constitutionalism&#39;. Lord Denning says: &quot;There are two aspects of the rule of law: on the one hand it prevents exercise of power arbitrarily, and on the other provides resource to law when power is exercised arbitrarily&quot;. The rule of law is, therefore, a foundation of the concept of good governance as well as justice.

According to Dicey there are three basic elements of rule of law:

1. Absence of arbitrary power on the part of the government: It means absolute supremacy of law. It excludes wide discretionary authority on the part of Government.
2. Equality before law: It involves:
   - Economic Equality:
   - Social Equality
     - Equal participation
     - Equal Responsibility
     - Equal Inclusion
    - Legal Equality
	  - Equal protection of Law
	  - Equality before Law
	- Political Equality
		- Equal voting Rights
3. Individual Liberty

## Principles of Rule of Law

The constitutional theorist Joseph Raz identified the constituent principles of his conception of the rule of law. Raz&#39;s conception encompasses the additional requirements of guiding the individual&#39;s behavior and minimizing the danger that results from the exercise of discretionary power in an arbitrary fashion, he stated that some of the most important principles were:

- That law should be **prospective** rather than retroactive.
- Laws should be relatively **stable**.
- There should be **general** rules and procedures for making laws.
- The **independence of the judiciary** has to be guaranteed.
- The principles of **natural justice** should be observed, particularly those concerning the right to a fair hearing.
- The courts should have **judicial review** power.
- The courts should be **accessible**; no man may be denied justice.
- The **discretion** of law enforcement and crime prevention agencies should not be allowed to pervert the law.

In his book The Morality of Law, American legal scholar Lon Fuller identified eight elements of law which have been recognized as necessary for a society aspiring to institute the rule of law. Fuller stated the following:

1.    Laws must exist and those laws should be obeyed by all, including government officials.
2.    Laws must be published.
3.    Laws must be prospective in nature so that the effect of the law may only take place after the law has been passed. For example, the court cannot convict a person of a crime committed before a criminal statute prohibiting the conduct was passed.
4.    Laws should be written with reasonable clarity to avoid unfair enforcement.
5.    Law must avoid contradictions.
6.    Law must not command the impossible.
7.    Law must stay constant through time to allow the formalization of rules; however, law also must allow for timely revision when the underlying social and political circumstances have changed.
8.    Official action should be consistent with the declared rule.

Thomas Paine stated in his pamphlet Common Sense (1776): &quot;For as in absolute governments the king is law, so in free countries the law ought to be king; and there ought to be no other.&quot;

According to Rawls, &quot;The conception of formal justice, the regular and impartial administration of public rules, becomes the rule of law when applied to legal system. &quot; he further says that rule of law is closely related with liberty. Notion of rule of law according to john Rawls are;
- The precepts of justice associated with rule of law.
- The rule of law implies the percept that similar cases be treated similarly.
- The there is no offense without a law.
- The percept defining the notion of natural justice.

## Nepalese examples:
1. Constitution of Nepal:
	- Preamble has clearly provided the principle of &#39;Rule of Law&#39;
	- Article 1: Laws inconsistent with the constitution to be void.
	- Laws, regulations and policies inconsistent to right to equality to be void.
	- Freedom and liberty are fundamental rights
2. The Section 9 of the Treaty Act, 1993, Provides for Application of Rule of Law with International Perspective as it Subjects the Legal Sanctity of the Nepalese Laws to Their Consistency with International Conventions and Treaties

## Public Administration and the Rule of Law:

State is a legal person. Officials of the state are directed to work as per law. The rights of officials are created by law. The rights provided by law are not unlimited and discretionary. Thus legal procedures are to be followed by the officials. If the officials don&#39;t follow legal obligations than the victims have right to legal remedies and compensation.

Thus Government officials cannot exercise a power unless and until it is authorized by some specific law. The actions not authorized by law cannot be the actions of the government as a government.

The administrative actions shall be predictable. It implies the following:
- Government action should have valid legal source
- The provision of fair hearing
- The duty to give reasons
- To provide adequate remedies
- Compensation
- Openness in procedures
- Opportunity for judicial review
- Public liability in tort
- Legal remedies or provision of appeal in administrative decisions.
