## Administrative Law
### Definition and Nature
Administrative law is the law relating public administration. It is concerned with the legal forms and constitutional status of public authorities; with their powers and duties and with the procedures followed in exercising them; with their legal relationships with one another, with the public and with their employees; which seek, in varied ways, to control their activities.

A first approximation to a definition of Administrative law is to say that “it is the law relating to the control of government power”

Wade asserts “the primary purpose of Administrative law therefore is to keep the powers of government within their legal bounds, so as to protect the citizen against their abuse. The powerful engines of authority must be prevented from running ‘amok’.” Important to note is that the whole essence of Administrative law is to advocate for or uphold natural justice most especially for public servants or any other person appearing before an administrative tribunal.

The legal regulation of governmental power (Admin law) is to be distinguished from the political control of governmental power (constitutional law). Keith observed:

“It is logically impossible to distinguish administrative from constitutional law and all attempts to do so are artificial”.

However, according to Holland, “Constitutional law describes the various organs of the government at rest, while administrative law describes them in motion” Therefore, according to this view, the structure of the legislature and executive comes within the purview of the constitutional law but there functioning comes within the sphere of administrative law.

According to Jennings- administrative law deals with the organization, functions, powers and duties of administrative authorities while constitutional law deals with the general principles relating to the organization and powers of the various organs of the state and their mutual relationship of these organs with the individuals. In other words, constitutional law deals with fundamentals while administrative law deals with details.

Some differences have been highlighted below:

| 9. | It imposes certain negative duties on administrators, if they are found violating the fundamental rights of the citizens and etc. It also imposes certain positive duties on administrators, viz, implementation of social welfare schemes. | The administrators have to follow constitutional law first and next the administrative law.
